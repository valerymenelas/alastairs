						<h3 class="title"> Introduction and Overview</h3>
							<p class="paragraph"> You have arrived at a web site that is provided by Alistair's (“Alistair's” or “we,” “our” or “us”).

							<p class="paragraph">Your decision to provide this information is voluntary, but if you choose not to provide this requested information you may not be able to take advantage of all of the Site’s features or our services.</p>	
						<h3 class="title">Information We Collect When You Use the Site</h3>
							<p class="paragraph">In addition to information that you choose to submit to us, we and/or our service providers may automatically collect and/or store certain information when you visit or interact with the Site (“Usage Information”). This Usage Information may be stored and/or accessed from your personal computer, laptop, tablet, mobile phone or other device (a “Device”) whenever you visit or interact with our Site.

								<ul class="privacylist"> 
									<li>your IP address or other unique identifier (“Device Identifier”)</li>
									<li>your Device browser, operating system and mobile network information</li>
									<li>the areas within our Site that you visit and your activities there, including remembering you and your preferences</li>
									<li>your general location, and</li>
									<li>certain other Device data, including the time of day you visit our Site, among other information.</li>
								</ul>
							<p class="paragraph">We may use various methods and technologies to collect and/or store Usage Information, such as:</p>	
								<ul class="privacylist">
									<li><strong>Cookies:</strong> A cookie is a file placed on a Device to uniquely identify your browser or to store information on your Device. Our Site may use HTTP cookies, HTML5 cookies, Flash cookies and other types of cookie technology to store information on local storage. Regular cookies may generally be disabled or removed by tools that are available as part of most commercial browsers, and in some (but not all) instances can be blocked by selecting certain settings. Each browser you use will need to be set separately and different browsers offer different functionality and options. Please note that these tools may not be effective with regard to Flash cookies or HTML5 cookies. For information on disabling Flash cookies, visit www.adobe.com. Please understand that if you disable or remove any type of cookie, some parts of our Site may not function properly.</li>
									<li><strong>Web Beacons:</strong> A Web Beacon is a small tag (which may be invisible to you) that may be placed on our Site’s pages and messages. Web beacons may be used by us for a number of purposes, including to count visitors to the Site, to monitor how users navigate the Site, to count how many emails that were sent were actually opened or to count how many particular links were actually viewed.</li>
									<li><strong>Embedded Script:</strong> An embedded script is programming code that is designed to collect information about your interactions with the Site, such as the links you click on. The code is temporarily downloaded onto your Device from our web server or a third party service provider, is active only while you are connected to the Site, and is deactivated or deleted thereafter. The embedded script does not collect your Personal Information.</li>
									<li><strong>ETag, or entity tag:</strong> An Etag or entity tag is a feature of the cache in browsers. It is an opaque identifier assigned by a web server to a specific version of a resource found at a URL. If the resource content at that URL ever changes, a new and different ETag is assigned. Used in this manner ETags are a form of Device Identifier. ETag tracking may generate unique tracking values even where the consumer blocks HTTP, Flash and/or HTML5 cookies.</li>
								</ul>
						<h3 class="title">Location-Based Information</h3>
							<p class="paragraph">Our Site (including our mobile apps) may use location-based services to verify your location, deliver you relevant content and/or advertising based on your location, as well as to share your location with our service providers as part of the location-based services we offer. Further, we or our service providers may use your location information to display our nearest Store location to you. You have the ability to turn location-based services on and off by adjusting the settings of your Internet browser or mobile device, or by following the standard uninstall process and removing all Pier 1 Imports applications from your mobile device.</p>		
						<h3 class="title">Information We Collect From Third Parties</h3>
							<p class="paragraph">We may also receive information about you from your friends and other third parties, and combine or link that information with information we have about you. To the extent we combine information we receive from third parties with your Personal Information, the combined information, unless disclosed otherwise, will be treated as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. In no other circumstances will this Privacy Policy apply to information we receive about you from third parties.</p>		
						<h3 class="title">Information We Collect When You Interact with Third-Party Sites </h3>
							<p class="paragraph">The Site may allow certain kinds of interactions between the Site and your account on a third-party site or application.

If you choose to use this functionality, the third-party site may send Personal Information about you to us. If so, we will treat this information as Personal Information under this Privacy Policy. In addition, we may provide links on the Site to facilitate sending a communication from the Site. For example, we may use third parties to facilitate emails, Tweets or Facebook postings. These third parties may retain any information used or provided in any such communications or activities and these third parties’ practices are not subject to our Privacy Policy. You should review the applicable third-party privacy policies before using such tools.</p>

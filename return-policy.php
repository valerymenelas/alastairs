					  <h2 class="title text-center">Alastair's Return Policy</h2>
							<p class="paragraph">For merchandise in its original condition, we will provide an exchange or refund in the original form of payment with your original or emailed receipt.</p>
							<p class="paragraph">If your receipt is older than 45 days, your purchase can be exchanged or we'll issue a store credit for the current selling price.</p>
							<p class="paragraph">Without a receipt, if you have a valid photo ID, we'll provide an exchange or store credit for the current selling price. This excludes specifically labeled merchandise, which may only be returned with your receipt.</p>
							<p class="paragraph">For returns of a store purchase, cash refunds are subject to store funds availability and may be paid via mail as a corporate-issued check.</p>
							<p class="paragraph">Except for seasonal merchandise, we will offer a one-time sale price adjustment, limited to 14 days from purchase date. Original or emailed receipt is required.</p>
							<p class="paragraph">Return shipping and delivery fees, plus any applicable oversize surcharge fees, will be deducted from the total refund. Shipping, In-Home Delivery, surcharges, delivery and handling fees are non-refundable.</p>
							<p class="paragraph">Because of the fragile nature of many Pier 1 items, extra care should be taken to ensure that a package arrives at our processing center in the same condition as you received it. Our Customer Relations team can provide detailed packing advice.</p>
							<p class="paragraph">Return shipments may take up to 14 business days to process.</p>
							<p class="paragraph">Items sent C.O.D. (Cash on Delivery) will not be received. Please refer to the instructions above for the accepted way to make a return.</p>
							<p class="paragraph">All sales are final on merchandise purchase “as-is” or with a “damage” discount.</p>
